# RAnalytics
This is my first R repository on GitHub, where I'm exploring and sharing my R programming projects and data analysis work. It's a collection of code, datasets, and documentation related to various data analysis and visualization tasks.  Feel free to explore my projects, provide feedback, and join me on this data-driven journey.
